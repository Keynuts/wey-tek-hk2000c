# WEY-TEK-HK2000C

More readme to follow, just getting started.

## Things to find out / do, learning about tis keyboard:

* Install usb mouse in"Host" (S6) port and see if it's signals are passed onto the PCs.
* Plug a shared (PS/2) mouse directly into the Kbd. Looks like that will get
forwarded to the active workstation, correct? **TBD**
* Do keys/scan codes sent for the "non-standard/PC" keys? For example the color
add-in modules, F13-F24, Attach, ... **No**, not when in PC emulation mode.
* Re-test for extended scan-codes for other emulations. (Sun, Trading devices, etc.)


## To buy:

* (Have, somewhere): 2 standard PC power plugs
* (Have, somewhere): 1 more powerstrip to power off 2nd kbd.
* Amazon: 6? short USB cables for simultaneous access to the 6 WS ports on a USB hub.
* Andreutech - Can I get a blank too?
* (Future) Carrying case for keyboard

## To Try

* Load & save set-up to/from controller


## To research / learn:

* What's the Host port on the connector box do?
* What are the specs for the add-on modules?
    * Hardware (connector, size, etc.)
    * Software (what choices for modules do I have?)
* How do I load new/different software into the keyboard for a different module?
* Can Hsau's USB-to-USB be pplaced between a hub and PC?


## From Andreutech (NY)

1.	The keyboards are HK2000C with PS/2, USB and serial ports. 
2.	The controllers are all Connector Box Va with the latest firmware
3.	EBS and Dealing add-on modules
4.	The standard PC power cords can be used on the power supply
5. The keyboards are preconfigured to work with six PC workstations on ports
USB1â€“USB6. All the keyboards and connector boxes have the latest firmware
installed.

## Future:

* Make a 10-key "side-car" for the left side if the case (G80-9009 has 14 on
left that Wey does not)
