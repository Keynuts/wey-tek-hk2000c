# WEY-TEK-HK2000C

More readme to follow, just getting started with a todo list so far.

## Email to Photoelectric:

* Bought my own: WEY HK2000C
* Connector Box Va
* EBS and Dealing add-on modules (10 keys each arranged with 2,2,4,2 keys per row.)
* The keyboards are preconfigured to work with six PC workstations on ports
USB1–USB6.
* Ebay URL: https://www.ebay.com/itm/HK2000C-KEYBOARD-kit-refurbished/172995887269
* I tried again signing up for an account to access tech documents at
weytec.com. This time I heard back. I got the firmware download application from
WEY Tec, happy to send you a copy. (Haven't tried it out yet. Don't know which
Windows OS it works with.
* I still haven't seen a doc on the interface to the add-on modules. Now I'm
(mildly) considering leaving the 16 button add-on in place (for looks and to
avoid a big hole), but disconnecting it. Then simulate it using an outboard
macro pad for the left side of the keyboard. Quite a ways off.
* I'll try emulation modes other than "PC" to see if I can get more scan codes.


## Things to find out / do, learning about this keyboard:

* Install usb mouse in"Host" (S6) port and see if it's signals are passed onto the PCs.
* Plug a shared (PS/2) mouse directly into the Kbd. Looks like that will get
forwarded to the active workstation, correct? **TBD** Interfaces include:
    * Serial (docs say: "RS232 compatible interface and MS-Mouse protocol")
    * PS/2
    * USB (maybe)
* Do keys/scan codes sent for the "non-standard/PC" keys? For example the color
add-in modules, F13-F24, Attach, ... **No**, not when in PC emulation mode.
* Re-test for extended scan-codes for other emulations. (Sun, Trading devices, etc.)


## To buy:

* (Have, somewhere): 2 standard PC power plugs
* (Have, somewhere): 1 more powerstrip to power off switch for the 2nd kbd.
* Amazon: 6? short USB cables for simultaneous access to the 6 WS ports on a USB
hub. Possible max of 12, TBD.
* Sent -- Email to Andreutech - Can I get a blank too?
* (Future) Carrying case for keyboard(s?)

## To Try

* Load & save set-up to/from controller. Should be built in. Should be easy.


## To research / learn:

* What's the Host port on the connector box do?
* What are the specs for the add-on modules?
    * Hardware (connector, size, etc.)
    * Software (what choices for modules do I have?)
* How do I load new/different software into the keyboard for a different module?
* Can Hsau's USB-to-USB be placed between a hub and PC to merge 6 keyboards,
through the same transform, into one?


## From Andreutech (NY)

1.	The keyboards are HK2000C with PS/2, USB and serial ports. 
2.	The controllers are all Connector Box Va with the latest firmware
3.	EBS and Dealing add-on modules in each
4.	The standard PC power cords can be used on the power supply
5. The keyboards are preconfigured to work with six PC workstations on ports
USB1–USB6. All the keyboards and connector boxes have the latest firmware
installed.

## Future:

* Make a 10 to 16-key "side-car" for the left side if the case (G80-9009 has 14 on
left that the Wey does not.)
