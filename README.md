# WEY-TEK-HK2000C

More readme to follow, just getting started.

## Things to find out / do, learning about tis keyboard:

* Install usb mouse in"Host" (S6) port and see if it's signals are passed onto the PCs.
* Plug a shared (PS/2) mouse directly into the Kbd. Looks like that will get
forwarded to the active workstation, correct? **TBD**
* Do keys/scan codes sent for the "non-standard/PC" keys? For example the color
add-in modules, F13-F24, Attach, ... **No**, not when in PC emulation mode.
* Re-test for extended scan-codes for other emulations. (Sun, Trading devices, etc.)


## To buy:

* (Have, somewhere): 2 standard PC power plugs
* (Have, somewhere): 1 more powerstrip to power off 2nd kbd.
* Amazon: 6? short USB cables for simultaneous access to the 6 WS ports on a USB hub.


## To research / learn:

* What's the Host port on the connector box do?
* What are the specs for the add-on modules?
    * Hardware (connector, size, etc.)
    * Software (what choices for modules do I have?)
* How do I load new/different software into the keyboard for a different module?
